𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝗳𝘂𝗹 𝗗𝘆𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗰 𝗗𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝗼𝗳 𝗚𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀 🌎💲

Hello Github Community!👋 Take a look at my new project on Global Salary Analysis. My goal is to uncover Insights and transform Numerical Data into Narratives. I prioritize data cleanliness for Optimal Utilization. This balanced approach serves both technical and Non-Technical Audiences, making Data easily Understandable. Then, I explore the comprehensive Dashboard to Derive Meaningful Conclusions from the Analysis. I have also created a separate sheet dedicated to a Full Map Visual to take a look at the bigger picture which is Fully Dynamic with the help of Data Validation. Also I have created a button by basic VBA code to navigate to the map sheet and come back to the Dashboard sheet. 📊📈
